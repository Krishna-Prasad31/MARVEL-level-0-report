# Task 1 : API
API(Application Programming interface) , API is a set of rules that governs the communication of frontend and backend in a website.For this task i made a **Weather Application**.Here the user gets an input component where they can enter a city name *for example: Bangalore*, when the user clicks enter, the webiste sends a request to the **OpenWeather** server and communicates with the server where it obatins realtime data about the weather and sends it back to the website in a json format. The json file which contains the data is then displayed Using *DOM Manipulation* and then displayed on the website.
For this website I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript
