# Task 2: API
API(Application Programming interface) , API is a set of rules that governs the communication of frontend and backend in a website.For this task i made a **Weather Application**.Here the user gets an input component where they can enter a city name *for example: Bangalore*, when the user clicks enter, the webiste sends a request to the **OpenWeather** server and communicates with the server where it obatins realtime data about the weather and sends it back to the website in a json format. The json file which contains the data is then displayed Using *DOM Manipulation* and then displayed on the website.
For this website I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript

# Task 3: Working with GitHub
As part of this task, I explored the given GitHub repository to understand its structure, commits, issues, pull requests, and GitHub Actions workflow. I identified a logical error in the add function of the Python code, corrected it in my fork, and committed the changes. I reviewed the existing GitHub Actions configuration and observed that the workflow is triggered on pull request events.I created a new branch, made a minimal valid change, and opened a pull request to demonstrate the contribution workflow. This pull request successfully triggered GitHub Actions, thereby completing the task and providing hands-on experience with collaborative development and CI workflows on GitHub.

# Task 4: Get familiar with the command line on ubuntu
To complete this task, I used **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** to run Linux commands in a Windows environment. Since I had prior experience using *Windows PowerShell*, the command-line interface was not unfamiliar to me; however, the commands themselves were different. Through this task, I learned several basic Linux commands that are commonly used, such as `mkdir`, `cd`, `touch`, `cat`, and `chmod`.

## The subtasks were:
- Create a folder named test.
- cd into that folder.
- Create a blank file without using any text editor.
- create 2600 folders in this folder where each folder is named like . For example, M90 or B56.
- concatenate two text files containing any random text and display them on the terminal.

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Create folder | `mkdir test`|
| Change directory | `cd test` |
| Create Blank File | `touch empty` |
| Create n folders | `for i in {1....2600}; do mkdir M$i; done`|
| Concatenate files | `cat file1.txt file2.txt` |

# Task 6: The Matrix Puzzle — Decode with NumPy & Reveal the Image

**Python** has a huge variety of libraries. **NumPy** and **Matpotlib** are two very useful libraries widely used for various applications having to deal with number system and data visualization.

## NumPy(Numerical Python):
- Used for numerical and scientific computing
- Efficient data structures to handle large arrays and matrices
- Includes functions to perform mathematical operations on the data
- Improves computational speed by using optimized, low-level implementations and by supporting operations on entire arrays without explicit loops.

## Matplotlib:
  - It allows users to create various types of plots such as line graphs, bar charts, histograms, etc
  - Helps in representing numerical data graphically making it easier to analyze patterns.

This task had a scrambled matrix , and my job was to reorder the matrix using NumPy operations and then reveal the image using Matplotlib.

### Operations used:
- `arr.shape` = returns the number of rows and columns of the matrix.
- `arr.size` = returns the total number of elements peresent in the arary.
- `arr.reshape()` = changes the shape of an array.
- `imshow()` = displays data as an image
- `show()` = displays the plot

In the end a **smiley face** was revealed

# TASK 7: Create a Portfolio Webpage
The portfolio website was developed to showcase my skills, projects and my tech backgoud in a structured and visually appealing manner. The portfolio webiste helps me present my works and projects to the recuiter, peers and collaborators in a single paltform.

I used HTML, CSS and React JS to develop my portfolio website
